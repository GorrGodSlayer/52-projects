Hello everyone! 
My name is Gorr, or GTGS, and i am new on GitHub, tho i have been coding for the good part of 5 years now. 
I wanted to make a small challenge for myself, where very week, or if i have time every couple of days, to keep me entertained i will post a new project,ranging from commonly needed budgeting apps to more nieche monitor tools and rpi tools. 
I wanted to call it 52 Project since i will be making a total of 52 small scale projects, which will take me approximately 9 months if my calculations are correct
Please, if you found any bugs or anything that i may have missed while coding bored out of my mind, please do let me know, i am always enthusiastic if someone opens a pull request. 
Thank you everyone, and pleased to meet you all
